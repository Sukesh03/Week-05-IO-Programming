## Overview

Week 5 marks the transition from learning individual concepts to developing cohesive, functional systems. Each mini-project applies key Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, collections, file handling, and exception management to real-world scenarios.

## Projects Covered

### Project 1: Bank Management System

- Implementation of inheritance, interfaces, and abstract classes
- Core banking operations and account management

### Project 2: Student Grade Tracker

- File input/output to store and retrieve student data
- Utilization of Map and List collections to organize and calculate grades

### Project 3: File Encryption/Decryption Tool

- Byte-level file processing techniques
- Basic encryption logic using key shifting algorithms

### Project 4: E-commerce Price Tracker

- File parsing and comparison for price tracking
- Application of OOP principles and encapsulation

### Project 5: Address Book Management

- Functionality to add, update, delete, and search contacts
- Data persistence using Java serialization
